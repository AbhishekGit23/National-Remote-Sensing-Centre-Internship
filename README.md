# National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) Internship by ISRO

## About NRSC
The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) is a leading organization under the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) that specializes in remote sensing and satellite data applications. As an intern at NRSC, I had the opportunity to work on two significant scenarios.

### Scenario 2
**Problem Statement:**
The Forest Department of Karnataka aims to protect endangered species in a tropical rainforest. They possess a dataset of deforestation events and a shapefile of the rainforest boundaries. The objective is to identify areas at the highest risk of deforestation and prioritize conservation efforts.

**My Solution:**
I developed a Python model to address this problem. The solution code and comprehensive documentation can be found in this [GitHub Repository](link_to_repo). Additionally, I have shared code snippets, visualizations, and other relevant materials in the Google Classroom.

### Scenario 3
**Problem Statement:**
A state Agricultural Development Officer is investigating the relationship between soil conditions and crop yields. They have access to a dataset of soil nutrient levels and a shapefile of agricultural land parcels. The goal is to identify areas with optimal soil conditions for specific crops and recommend suitable crop types.

**My Solution:**
I created a Python model to solve this problem, and the code along with detailed documentation is available in this [GitHub Repository](link_to_repo). Similar to Scenario 2, I have shared code, visualizations, and additional resources in the Google Classroom.

## Importance of the Features
1. **Scenario 2 - Deforestation Risk Assessment:**
   - **Conservation Focus:** By identifying high-risk deforestation areas, the Forest Department can concentrate their conservation efforts where they are most needed, ensuring effective resource allocation.
   - **Environmental Impact:** Protecting tropical rainforests contributes to biodiversity conservation and helps combat climate change.

2. **Scenario 3 - Soil Conditions and Crop Yields:**
   - **Optimal Farming Practices:** Recommending suitable crops based on soil conditions helps optimize agricultural productivity, ensuring that farmers cultivate crops best suited for their land.
   - **Sustainable Agriculture:** By promoting optimal soil-crop matches, the Agricultural Development Officer can contribute to sustainable agricultural practices, reducing environmental impact.
